To authenticate your API requests, you will need to:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your Credentials">
    Get your `clientId` and `clientSecret` from Covver's dev team (rnd@covver.io).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Access Token">
    Use your credentials to create an `accessToken` (see below).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the Access Token">
    Add the `accessToken` in `Bearer Authentication` for each API Request.
  </Step>
</Steps>

 

## Creating Access Tokens
There are 2 ways to create access tokens:

- [Using a refresh token](/api-reference/auth/refresh-token)
